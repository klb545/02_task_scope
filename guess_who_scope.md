# Guess Who

Now that you know about scope, and the difference between the `let` and `const` keywords, consider each `GUESS` in `task_scope_guesswho_start_code`. Use your knowledge to predict what the outcome or error will be.

- **Make a copy** of the start code from GitHub. As ever, do not work in coursenotes.
- We suggest that you begin by commenting out ALL the code, **apart from the `GUESS` you are working on**.
- In a comment below the `GUESS`, write your predicted outcome.
- run the code to see if you're right! `node task_scope_guesswho_start_code.js`
